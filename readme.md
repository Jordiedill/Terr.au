About

This application was originally built in two days and shows animations of the planets in our solar system as well as distance from Earth in Astronomical Units and miles.I focused heavily on the front end and the user interface. This application was created using React Native.

Future of this application

I will connect this application to an API which takes in the latitude and longitude of a users current location and returns the distance from them in real time.
